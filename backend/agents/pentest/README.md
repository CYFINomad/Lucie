## Features

- Automated reconnaissance and scanning
- Vulnerability assessment and exploitation
- Post-exploitation analysis
- Report generation in multiple formats
- Integration with popular security tools
- Maltego integration for visual mapping
- Learning capabilities for improved detection

## Usage

Each agent can be used independently or as part of a complete penetration testing workflow. The agents support:

1. Automated scanning and enumeration
2. Vulnerability detection and assessment
3. Exploitation and post-exploitation
4. Report generation
5. Integration with security tools
6. Data correlation and analysis

## Configuration

API keys, tool configurations, and sensitive settings should be stored in the appropriate configuration files and never committed to the repository.
